# Employee Tracker

## Description

The Employee Tracker is a command line application, created to easily view and edit various employee data. From the integrated terminal, the user can view employees, roles, and departments. They can also choose to add an employee, a role, and a department. The application also allows the user to update an employee's role or an employee's manager. They also have the ability to delete an employee. In building this application, I learned how to use switch statements, Sql query statements, and practiced importing and exporting functions. I also learned how 'view' functions within inquirer prompts can also be used for other funtions.

## Usage

From the command line, run node index to start the application. The user can then select the option they'd like, and answer the prompts as they appear.

## Credits

I worked with my tutor, John Titus, on shifting some of the map functions around and cleaning up existing code.
